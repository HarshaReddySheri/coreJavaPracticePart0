	 * 
	 * SYNTAX for writing a method
	 * ******
	 * 
	 * accessModifier staticOrNonStatic returnType MethodName (parameters) throws ExceptionList{
	 * ______________					__________ __________
	 * 
	 * ------------->Underline are Mandatory
	 * 
	 *  //Method Body
	 *  
	 *  return value;

	 *  --> properties & behavior
	 *  
	 *   car								Object 
	 *   --> properties Or Fields 			-->Variable
	 *   --> behavior Or Action				-->Method
	 *   
	 *   Why we create a method?
	 *   
	 *   To perform any action we create method
	 *   When we create a method we place a code in-it
	 *   
	 *   How many method we can create in class?
	 *   There is no count of min & max
	 *   
	 *   Zero method's also in class, their is no error in-it.
	 *   
	 *   min-0
	 *   max-N no of Method's
	 *   
	 *   class & method must have a relation 
	 *   EX:
	 *   house
	 *   --> 4 room
	 *   		-->If your bed room has large space then everything you want to place in-it
	 *   			-->Kitchen things in kitchen
	 *   			-->Bathroom things in bath room
	 *   so that class has their methods in a relation
	 *   
	 *    
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   
	 *
