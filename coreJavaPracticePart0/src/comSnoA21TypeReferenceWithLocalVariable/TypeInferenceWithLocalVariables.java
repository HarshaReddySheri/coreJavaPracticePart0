	 * 1.What is type inference?
	 * Ans: Type inference is a concept in which the compiler infers the type of the variable using the value provided.
	 * 
	 * This type inference is restricted to local variable's
	 * This feature is introduced in java 10 version 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2.How to use var key word?
	 * 
	 * var i = 10;
	 * declaration & initialization at same time
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 3. var keyword restrictions?
	 * Ans: var can only be used in the local variables
	 * 		var can't be used for only declaration purpose, instead it should be used along with initialization
	 * 		When used with arrays, should not use the [] brackets
	 * 		Var can't be used in In-Line array initialization but specifying the datatype
