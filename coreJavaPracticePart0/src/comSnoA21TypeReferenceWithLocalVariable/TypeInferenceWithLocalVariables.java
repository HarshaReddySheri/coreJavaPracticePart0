	 * If i don't have a knowledge on java dataType let assume
	 * If i want to defined & initialize variable but can i do without dataType
	 * 
	 *  Here upto now we don't see
	 *  Here no need of confusion for java we specified variable with dataType
	 *  
	 *  Let tale example of javaScript, Python, TyprScript
	 *  simply we have a var, Let, const --->3 TypesOnly
	 *  
	 *  Major usage is var keyword
	 *  
	 *  these concept were missing in java
	 *  
	 *  java {team} were decided to introduce these feature for benefits of usage
	 *  
	 *  var is applicable for java 
	 *  not all versions of java only after version10
	 *  
	 *  No need of specify the dataType in java if you are are beginner
	 *  
	 *  These concept is known as typeInference
	 *  
	 *  java become more intelligence
	 *  
	 *  java said that no need of specify dataType -Mention var --> I will take care of it
	 *  
	 *  infers --means--> selfChosen Or SelfCare
	 *

	 * Agenda
	 * ******
	 * 1.What is type inference?
	 * Ans: Type inference is a concept in which the compiler infers 
	 * 		the type of the variable using the value provided.
	 * 
	 * This type inference is restricted to local variable's
	 * This feature is introduced in java 10 version 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2.How to use var key word?
	 * 
	 * var i = 10;
	 * declaration & initialization at same time
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 3. var keyword restrictions?
	 * Ans: var can only be used in the local variables
	 * 		var can't be used for only declaration purpose, instead it should be used along with initialization
	 * 		When used with arrays, should not use the [] brackets
	 * 		Var can't be used in In-Line array initialization but specifying the dataType
	 * 	
	 * 	var can also use for object creation
